# CODEGEN Brief

## Progress – D
- Implemented chamfer-grid based calibration with axis-aligned affine model search.
- Added segment sampling, chamfer scoring, and residual metrics computation.
- Integrated flip-aware RANSAC across configured rotation hypotheses with local refinement.
- Built deterministic synthetic tests covering 0° and 180° scenarios for regression safety.
