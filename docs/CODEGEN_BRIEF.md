# Code Generation Brief

## Progress – E
- Chamfer-based line support scoring multiplies average exponential support with PDF segment length.
- Segment grid accelerates SVG proximity queries and falls back to full scan if sparse.
- Greedy selector enforces 2×H/2×V balance when available and maintains center diversity.
- Diversity is relaxed only as a fallback, with notes capturing shortages or relaxations.
